# svelte app

## what you enjoyed about using the chosen framework

> Disclaimer: I messed with React and Vue a bit, and messed with Juice Shop enough to get a sense for Angular. I didn't take my time as much as I could have going through the tutorial, so I still only have a very basic knowledge of this framework.

### Fireship uses it!
I think very highly of Fireship from YouTube, and he loves Svelte so it was a clear choice for me.

### Web development is awesome in general
This is the coolest assignment I've ever had. I want to go deeper into web development with bootcamps, the Odin Project, so I'll take whatever I can get my hands on to grow in this area.

### Svelte in particular
The **syntax** of Svelte is the most intuitive of all the JS frameworks I've seen so far. I do like they're **approach to reactivity** by surgically updating the DOM rather than a virtual DOM. I'm sure there are tradeoffs to choosing an approach, but I'd be interested to learn more. 

## what you disliked

### I do not like Jest
I decided to write playwright tests to make sure nothing broke as I developed features. It also helped me feel a certain amount of autonomy; instead of blindly following a tutorial, I was able to make it my own. I'm used to the pytest API, so using Playwright's Node.js API was exciting. However, I decided to use it with Jest which was a time suck and a learning moment to never use Jest again. I used Playwright as the test runner and the VS Code extension blew my mind.

### Svelte stores
When I implemented stores, it broke the tests, and I was confused. I'm not exactly sure what happened, because each test run should have set up the same environment in a new browser window for each feature. I think I changed a test fixture before block to the wrong scope at the same time as implementing stores. Once I got the tests in CIT and changed the test fixture, they were working again.

## something entertaining. Cats are no longer entertaining.
If you look at the Kratos employee headshots on SharePoint, you will find Kratos from God of War.
